##  Credit_Card_Analytics-_Dashboard
📌 Project Overview:
This dashboard project uses weekly data to provide clear insights into:
💰 Where the money is coming from    
👥 Who the most valuable customers are    
🛍️ What people are spending on    
🕒 Which weeks saw high or low spending    
📈 How performance is changing over time    
There are two main dashboards:    
1. Customer Overview Dashboard – Shows who your customers are and how valuable they are.  
2. Transaction Overview Dashboard – Shows how customers are spending money and what brings in the most revenue.  
The dashboards were developed to help financial institutions understand customer behaviors, spending patterns, interest income, revenue sources, and demographic segmentation for strategic decisions.    
## 🧠 Problem Statement:    
Banks and credit card companies collect huge amounts of customer and transaction data every day. But just having data isn’t enough—they need to understand customer behavior, track spending patterns, and identify revenue sources in order to make smarter decisions.
The challenge is:    
How do we turn this complex data into something easy to understand?    
How can managers quickly find out which customers are bringing in money and which services are popular?    
How do we know who might leave or what to improve?    
## 🎯 Goals of the Dashboard:          
🧠 Help non-technical users like sales managers, marketers, or executives get answers without reading raw data.    
📊 Present important weekly trends in revenue, spending habits, and satisfaction.       
🔍 Visualize credit card revenue, transaction volumes, and interest earned.      
🧾 Segment customer insights by age, gender, income, education, marital status, and job roles.    
🧠 Identify high-performing customer segments and revenue-driving geographies.    
💡 Track performance metrics across time and categories for better decision-making.
